A number of examples showing of Chisel's advantanges as a Hardware Construction Language.


*Quick Start*

If you need this two work instead Intel, you'll need to do the following steps once:

-- Find a work disk. Call it $WORK. Then issue:

```
mkdir $WORK/.sbt
mkdir $WORK/.ivy2
mkdir $WORK/.cache
```

-- Make sure `~/.sbt`, `~/.ivy2`, and `~/.cache` are empty. Then issue:
```
rm -rf ~/.sbt
rm -rf ~/.ivy2
```
Either remove `~/.cache` similarly or move the contents to `$WORK/.cache`

-- Use links in the home directory to the work disk so you donâ€™t fill up your home directory.
```
cd ~
ln -s $WORK/.sbt
ln -s $WORK/.ivy2
ln -s $WORK/.cache .
```

-- Set proxies
```
setenv HTTPS_PROXY http://proxy-us.intel.com:912
setenv HTTP_PROXY http://proxy-us.intel.com:912
setenv http_proxy http://proxy-us.intel.com:912
setenv https_proxy http://proxy-us.intel.com:912

```
